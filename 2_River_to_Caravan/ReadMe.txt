The notebooks Caravan_part1_Earth_Engine.ipynb and Caravan_part2_local_postprocessing.ipynb are adapted versions of the original Kratzert notebook, designed for converting Flanders catchments into the Caravan data format.

Important:

The first notebook must be executed in Google Colab to ensure seamless access to Google Earth Engine.

Prior to running these notebooks, the shapefile components (.shp, .dbf, and .shx) generated in Step 1 must be uploaded as a new asset in Google Earth Engine.

Alternatively, this upload step can be bypassed by running the script Loading_input_data.py located in the corresponding LOADING INPUT folder.

The output produced by the second notebook is saved to the folder output_caravan.

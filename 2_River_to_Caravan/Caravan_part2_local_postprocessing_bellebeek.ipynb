        "- an open source, large-sample rainfall-runoff dataset.\n",
        "- derived entirely in the cloud (Earth Engine).\n",
        "- a dataset that only uses globally available data products (namely [ECMWF's ERA5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview) and [HydroATLAS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydroatlas) by Linke et al.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "- to democratize large-sample hydrology: Anyone can extend the dataset to new regions without downloading and preprocessing large amounts of raw data. Instead, we use freely available cloud resources to do all heavy lifting in the cloud and only download the processed results.\n",
        "- to advance research on global rainfall-runoff models: So far, we have seen  different large-sample datasets (e.g. CAMELS variants) that are specific to individual countries. However, due to the use of data products with only local coverage (e.g. meteorological forcing data or static attribute maps), intercomparisons betweens these products are not straight forward.\n",

        "We envision Caravan as a dynamically growing dataset that can be extended by its users. While making a large-sample dataset available upon the intial publication, the distribution of the basins is still limited to a few regions in the world. Ideally, this will change over time. Anyone who uses Caravan and this code to extend the dataset is invited to also share the streamflow time series data with the community, even if it is just for a single (or a few) basins. By doing so, little by little, we could create a new, globally spanning open source dataset that anyone can use for their own work/research. For the moment, the [discussion forum](https://github.com/kratzert/Caravan/discussions) on the Github repository is the place to share information on data that you want to contribute. See also the [wiki](https://github.com/kratzert/Caravan/wiki) on Github for further information.\n",

        "## Aggregate to daily resolution\n",
        "\n",
        "To be able to convert the hourly ERA5-Land data to daily aggregates we need to execute the following steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Disaggregate ERA5-Land features that are provided as accumulates over the day (see explanation below).\n",
        "2. Convert ERA5-Land variables to units more common for hydrological applications.\n",
        "3. Shift to local time and aggregate to daily resolution (see explanation below).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Disaggregate ERA5Land features and convert units\n",
        "\n",
        "Some ERA5-Land features accumulate their values over one day (in UTC). Meaning that, e.g., the precipitation value at `01:00` contains the total precipitation that has fallen from `00:00` to `01:00` and the value of `02:00` contains the total precipitation that has fallen from `00:00` to `02:00` (and not the amount that has fallen from `01:00` to `02:00`). Because we want to convert the hourly UTC data to local time (below), we first disaggregate the cumulated features into hourly \"instantaneous\" (or hourly accumulated) values. Due to some numerical issues (on Earth Engine/ERA5-Land side), there might also be some physically implausible values, e.g., instead of 0 mm precipitation there is a very tiny negative value. We clip these cases to zero. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Unit conversion\n",
        "We convert the ERA5-Land features into units that are more common in hydrology (e.g., precipitation in mm instead of m). For details see the `era5l_unit_conversion` in `caravan_utils.py` or check the metadata that is stored in the netCDF files. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Aggregate to daily statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "Special care has to be taken when computing daily aggregates from hourly values, especially with those features that are accumulates, rather than instantenous values. Of the features included in Caravan, `total_precipitation`,`potential_evaporation`, `surface_net_solar_radiation`, and `surface_net_thermal_radiation` are accumulates, while all others are instantenous values. For the accumulates, according to the [ERA5Land documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5-Land%3A+data+documentation#ERA5Land:datadocumentation-accumulationsAccumulations), the value that is stored at e.g. 1981-01-01 00:00 is the value that is accumulated over the previous hour _up to_ 00:00. This means that this value should not be included when computing the daily statistics for 1981-01-01. The 24 data points that should be included to compute e.g. the daily statistics for 1981-01-01 are from 1981-01-01 01:00 until (including) 1981-01-02 00:00. We need to consider this when we use the resampling function of the pandas library, which does (by defaul) resample by date, which would be wrong in this case. We can mitigate that by passing an `offset=pd.Timedelta(hours=-1)` to the resample function. For the instantenous values it doesn't really make a difference if the steps 00:00 to 23:00 are used, or also the values 01:00 to 00:00 (==24:00). Therefore, we chose to take the same timesteps as for the accumulates."
